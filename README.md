## Completed Exercises

### Part 0 â€“ Fundamentals of Web Apps

This part introduces the **client-server model**, basic **HTTP communication**, and how modern single-page applications (SPAs) behave compared to multi-page apps.

## Key Learnings

- **JSX & Component Structure**: Built reusable components using React and passed data via props.
- **State Handling with `useState`**: Managed application state like counters, selected anecdotes, and votes.
- **Conditional Rendering**: Displayed different UI outputs based on current state (e.g. "No feedback given").
- **Array Operations**: Used `.map()`, `Math.max()`, `.indexOf()`, and array copying techniques to handle lists of data and votes.
- **Semantic HTML**: Applied tags like `<table>`, `<tr>`, and `<td>` for layout clarity and accessibility.
- **Server Communication**: Implemented CRUD operations using `axios` and REST APIs.
- **Error Handling**: Added user notifications and error messages for better UX.
- **External APIs**: Integrated with REST Countries API and weather services.
- **Module Structure**: Organized code into reusable services and components.
