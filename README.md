## Key Learnings

- **JSX & Component Structure**: Built reusable components using React and passed data via props.
- **State Handling with `useState`**: Managed application state like counters, selected anecdotes, and votes.
- **Conditional Rendering**: Displayed different UI outputs based on current state (e.g. "No feedback given").
- **Array Operations**: Used `.map()`, `Math.max()`, `.indexOf()`, and array copying techniques to handle lists of data and votes.
- **Semantic HTML**: Applied tags like `<table>`, `<tr>`, and `<td>` for layout clarity and accessibility.
- **Server Communication**: Implemented CRUD operations using `axios` and REST APIs.
- **Error Handling**: Added user notifications and error messages for better UX.
- **External APIs**: Integrated with REST Countries API and weather services.
- **Module Structure**: Organized code into reusable services and components.
- **Backend Development**: Built RESTful APIs using Node.js and Express.
- **Database Integration**: Connected application to MongoDB using Mongoose.
- **Deployment**: Deployed full-stack application to production using Render.
- **Code Quality**: Implemented ESLint for consistent code style and error checking.
