In my ex1.1.jsx file, I have refactored the original code so that it consists of 3 new components, namely a Header, Content, and Total child components of the App component. 

In my ex1.2.jsx file, I have refactored the Content component further by breaking it down into separate Part components, one for each course part. I utilised the map() function to make the rendering of data in the parts array more dynamic
