# ðŸ“˜ Course Information App (Exercises 1.1 â€“ 1.5)

This React application was built as part of the [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part1) course offered by the University of Helsinki. It serves as an introduction to React fundamentals like components, props, JSX, and state management. The app displays course information (course name, parts, and exercise count) in a structured and modular format.

## What It Does

Displays a courseâ€™s:

- Name
- Parts
- Number of exercises per part
- Total number of exercises

---

## Concepts Covered

| Exercise | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **1.1**  | Hardcoded output of course name and exercise count using JSX |
| **1.2**  | Refactored code into components: `Header`, `Content`, `Total` |
| **1.3**  | Used JavaScript objects to store part data |
| **1.4**  | Stored multiple parts in an array of objects |
| **1.5**  | Combined course name and parts into a single object and used `map()` to render parts dynamically |

## Technologies Used

- React (via Vite)
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- JSX

## Key Learnings

- **JSX Basics**: Understood how HTML-like syntax (JSX) integrates with JavaScript inside React components.
- **Component Decomposition**: Learned to break down UI into smaller components like Header, Content, and Total to improve modularity and readability.
- **Prop Passing**: Gained experience passing data from parent to child components using props to ensure clean data flow.
- **Using JavaScript in JSX**: Practiced embedding expressions and variables directly inside JSX.
- **Data Structures in React**: Learned to manage and structure component data using JavaScript objects and arrays.
- **Dynamic Rendering:** Used `map()` to dynamically render multiple parts, enabling scalability without hardcoding.
