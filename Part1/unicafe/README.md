# ðŸ“Š Unicafe Feedback App (Exercises 1.6 â€“ 1.11)

This is a simple React application built as part of the [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) course offered by the University of Helsinki. It simulates a feedback system for a fictional university cafÃ© called **Unicafe**. The app demonstrates fundamental React concepts such as component decomposition, state handling, conditional rendering, and rendering structured data using HTML tables.

## What It Does

Users can give feedback in three categories:

- **Good**
- **Neutral**
- **Bad**

The app then displays:

- Count of each feedback type
- Total number of feedbacks
- Average score
- Percentage of positive feedback
