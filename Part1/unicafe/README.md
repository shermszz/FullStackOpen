# üìò Unicafe Feedback App (Exercises 1.6 ‚Äì 1.11)

This is a simple React application built as part of the [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part1) course offered by the University of Helsinki. It simulates a feedback system for a fictional university caf√© called **Unicafe**. The app demonstrates fundamental React concepts such as component decomposition, state handling, conditional rendering, and rendering structured data using HTML tables.

---

## What It Does

Users can give feedback in three categories:

- **Good**
- **Neutral**
- **Bad**

The app then displays:

- Count of each feedback type
- Total number of feedbacks
- Average score
- Percentage of positive feedback

## Concepts Covered

| Exercise | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **1.6**  | Collect and display the number of good, neutral, and bad feedbacks |
| **1.7**  | Add total count, average score, and positive percentage |
| **1.8**  | Extract `Statistics` into its own component |
| **1.9**  | Conditionally show `"No feedback given"` if total is 0 |
| **1.10** | Extract each line into a reusable `StatisticLine` component |
| **1.11** | Display all statistics inside an HTML `<table>` for better layout |

## Technologies Used

- React (via Vite)
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- HTML

## Key Learnings

- Component-Based Design: Learned how to decompose a UI into reusable, functional components like Button, StatisticLine, and Statistics.
- React State Management: Used the useState hook to track user interactions and feedback counts in real-time.
- Conditional Rendering: Applied logic to display different content (e.g. ‚ÄúNo feedback given‚Äù) based on state conditions.
- State-Driven Calculations: Calculated derived values like average and positive percentage based on current state.
- Prop Passing & Reusability: Passed data and functions down to child components using props to keep the app modular and maintainable.
- HTML Semantics & Layout: Leveraged semantic tags like <table>, <tbody>, <tr>, and <td> for better structure and layout clarity in displaying data.
