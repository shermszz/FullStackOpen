# ðŸ“˜ Unicafe Feedback App (Exercises 1.6 â€“ 1.11)

This is a simple React application built as part of the [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part1) course offered by the University of Helsinki. It simulates a feedback system for a fictional university cafÃ© called **Unicafe**. The app demonstrates fundamental React concepts such as component decomposition, state handling, conditional rendering, and rendering structured data using HTML tables.

---

## What It Does

Users can give feedback in three categories:

- **Good**
- **Neutral**
- **Bad**

The app then displays:

- Count of each feedback type
- Total number of feedbacks
- Average score
- Percentage of positive feedback

## Concepts Covered

| Exercise | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **1.6**  | Collect and display the number of good, neutral, and bad feedbacks |
| **1.7**  | Add total count, average score, and positive percentage |
| **1.8**  | Extract `Statistics` into its own component |
| **1.9**  | Conditionally show `"No feedback given"` if total is 0 |
| **1.10** | Extract each line into a reusable `StatisticLine` component |
| **1.11** | Display all statistics inside an HTML `<table>` for better layout |

## Technologies Used

- React (via Vite)
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- HTML

## ðŸ“˜ Key Learnings

- **Component-Based Design**: Learned how to decompose a UI into reusable, functional components like `Button`, `StatisticLine`, and `Statistics`.
- **Props and Data Flow**: Passed data from parent to child components using props to render dynamic content.
- **Array Rendering**: Used `.map()` to iterate over arrays and render multiple components efficiently.
- **JSX Syntax**: Practiced embedding expressions within JSX using `{}` and combining HTML-like elements with JavaScript.
- **State-Free Logic**: Focused on data structuring and rendering logic without `useState`, emphasizing the fundamentals of component behavior.
- **HTML Semantics & Layout**: Used semantic elements like `<table>`, `<tbody>`, `<tr>`, and `<td>` to present structured data clearly and improve accessibility and layout.
